## Overview
I built this app to get familiar with the following concepts:
- React Router - creating a multi-page app.
- React Router - mapping URLs to products.
- React - using React Hooks (useEffect and useState).
- Using [MUI](https://mui.com/), a Component library for React.
- Creating Modal components with MUI.
- [Deploying](https://medium.com/@isharamalaviarachchi/how-to-deploy-your-react-app-into-github-pages-b2c96292b18e) React apps to Github Pages

### Tech used
- Javascript
- Webpack
- npm
- Prettier + ESLint
- ![MUI](https://mui.com/)
- ![React JS](https://reactjs.org/) Hooks
- ![React Router](https://reactrouterdotcom.fly.dev/docs/en/v6)
- ![uniqid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid) (Generating unique keys for lists of React Components)

## Lessons learned
- I learned how to map different product IDs to their individual URLs.
- I learned how to detect when specific state properties change, using the React useEffect hook.
- I had difficulty with code repetition for the <Header /> component, which I will solve next time by placing that component higher up in the component heirarchy.
